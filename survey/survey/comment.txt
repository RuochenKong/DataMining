the problem is interesting and important and the motivation is clear; 
the scope is good; 
I feel there are more methods even only based on the contents, 
	and can there be a better (more logical) way to categorize them instead of just putting out three (sort of random) ones? 
The possible outcomes are missing-- what can be achieved in this survey?-- 
no need to answer these questions now, 
but just consider them for the actual survey.
